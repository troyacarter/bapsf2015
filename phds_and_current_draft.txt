Jan 8 2014 Science Council Report excerpt:
In the last five years, BaPSF has produced 18 PhDs, 11 of them from UCLA, 2 fromUniv. Calif. - Irvine, and 5 of them from institutions outside California. Three Mastersof Science degrees were awarded over the same duration. Two of these M.S. recipients arepursuing their PhDs in Germany. The PhD recipients continued their careers at NationalLaboratories (1 each at LLNL and General Atomics), at Universities (5), and in Industries(8 at LAM, Intel, and others) in direct support of the Fusion program, in independentresearch and teaching, and in maintaining US competitiveness in the semi-conductor industry.Walter and the BaPSF
