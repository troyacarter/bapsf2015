\section*{Budget Justification}

\subsection*{Personnel and Benefits}
The major component of the budget is related to salaries. In the first
year regular salaries, together with overhead and benefits, and
salaries associated with fabrication (under “High Tech Shop Costs”)
amount to \$1.48M. This amount covers summer months for the PIs who are
faculty members. Full-year support for the research staff, and the
administrative and technical support staff is also included. The
support staff consists of an experienced engineer, a full time
machinist and an expert on circuit design, construction, who is also
adept at building microscopically small probes. As the facility
supports some of the research of the local group, three full-time
graduate students are included in the budget.  The specific salaries
and benefits for each individual are determined by strict guidelines
set by the University of California and subject to rigorous
review. Each listed salary is based on the individual’s current level
and increased each year for cost of living and merit increase (5\% cola
for academic personnel, 4\% cola for staff, 7\% for faculty merit
increases which occur every few years). Benefits are the actual
benefits of each employee.  


\subsection*{Equipment and Fabrication}
 Each year there
is \$60k allotted for continuing modification to current equipment
(scopes, pumps, signal generators). The actual needs in this category
vary from year to year.  Each year, equipment in support of
user experiments and campaigns is designed and constructed by the
BaPSF staff. The planned fabrication items are called out in the
budget, but include plasma sources, amplifiers, high-power switches
and probes.  There is a budget item for upgrade of the facility
equipment (e.g., scopes, meters). This is necessary, as there comes a
time when it is not cost effective to repair old equipment and it must
be replaced. In the first year we plan to purchase a high frequency
vector network analyzer. These are invaluable in the calibration and
testing of probes and circuits. Several experiments at BaPSF are now
in high frequency (electron plasma and electron cyclotron) regimes and
an analyzer capable of operation at up to 20 GHz is necessary.  

\subsection*{Travel}

The travel budget allows the PIs and staff to attend major national
scientific meetings such as APS-DPP and to participate international
meetings such as the International Conference on Plasma Physics
(ICPP), the Interrelationship of Plasma Experiments in the Laboratory
and Space (IPELS), the Trieste Summer School on Plasma Physics and
major topical workshops. Travel to these various meetings is necessary
to present the work done at BaPSF to wide audiences and to fulfill the
“Broader Impact” goals of the proposal.  

\subsection*{Other Direct Costs}

The materials and supplies category includes \$35K for necessary small
replacement parts as well as \$30K for electrical supplies. \$30K has
been allocated for scientific publications as a result of this
project. The additional direct costs include the following: - \$100k
allotted each year for partial payment of electricity costs; UCLA
absorbs the balance.  - There are three laser systems (two Nd-Yag
lasers and a pulsed tunable dye laser) used in support of several
experiments and for diagnostics. All the lasers must be kept under
service contract, as a single repair on any of them equals the price
of a year- long service contract. The lasers are fragile and usually
break more than once a year. The service contract also includes a
yearly alignment to bring the laser up to its quoted
specifications. \$30K is budgeted for this each year - UCLA’s mandatory
Technology infrastructure fee which is \$40.75 per month for each FTE
paid by this project - \$15K per year for telecommunications
expenses. All expenses for phone lines and conference calls are
related to the research done in this lab and are budgeted in this
grant.  - Mandatory Graduate student fee remissions in the amount of
\$10,410 for Year 1 and inflated for subsequent years.  Overhead
Overhead in the amount of 54\% has been added to all items excluding
equipment, fabrication, and Graduate Student Fee remission as per
UCLA’s negotiated rate.  



\subsubsection*{UCLA Contribution}

 Aside from the usage of
nearly an entire building (the Science and Technology Research
Building) on Campus the Dean of the College of Letters and Science has
promised one quarter of teaching relief each year for the director of
the BaPSF.
