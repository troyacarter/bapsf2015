\section*{Budget Justification}

\subsection*{Personnel and Benefits}

Funds are requested to provide 1 month of summer salary for the PI,
Prof. Troy Carter and faculty Co-PIs Prof. Walter Gekelman and
Prof. George Morales.  Support for 1 month of Co-PI Dr. Steve Vincena
is requested.  The specific salaries and benefits for each individual
are determined by strict guidelines set by the University of
California and subject to rigorous review. Each listed salary is based
on the individual’s current level and increased each year for cost of
living and merit increase (5\% COLA for academic personnel, 4\% COLA
for staff, 7\% for faculty merit increases which occur every few
years). Benefits are the actual benefits of each employee.  Fringe
benefits are charged to all senior and other new personnel at a
composite rate set by the Regents of University of California.  PI and
Co-I salaries are charged at a rate of 12.7\%.  Existing employee use
actual rates.  Benefit rates are increased 2\% each fiscal year.




\subsection*{Equipment and Fabrication}

Funds are requested for fabrication of experimental apparatus and for
continuing modification to current equipment.   The actual needs in this category
vary from year to year (e.g. repairing/replacing pump-down stations,
mechanical and electrical components of the LAPD, etc.).  Each year, equipment in support of
user experiments and campaigns is designed and constructed by the
BaPSF staff. The planned fabrication items include
include plasma sources, amplifiers, high-power switches
and probes.   Funds are requested to support fabrication of apparatus
for the LAPTAG outreach program.  


\subsection*{Travel}

The travel budget allows the PIs
to attend major national scientific meetings such as APS-DPP and to
participate international meetings such as the International
Conference on Plasma Physics (ICPP), the Interrelationship of Plasma
Experiments in the Laboratory and Space (IPELS), the Trieste Summer
School on Plasma Physics and major topical workshops. Travel to these
various meetings is necessary to present the work done at BaPSF to
wide audiences and to fulfill the “Broader Impact” goals of the
proposal.


\subsection*{Other Direct Costs}

The materials and supplies category includes funds for necessary small
replacement parts as well as for electrical supplies. Funds are
allocated for scientific publications as a result of this project. The
additional direct costs include the following.  There are three laser
systems (two Nd-Yag lasers and a pulsed tunable dye laser) used in
support of several experiments and for diagnostics. All the lasers
must be kept under service contract, as a single repair on any of them
equals the price of a year-long service contract. The lasers are
fragile and usually break more than once a year. The service contract
also includes a yearly alignment to bring the laser up to its quoted
specifications.  Participant support costs are requested to facilitate
travel of high school students and teachers participating in the
LAPTAG outreach program.  Travel to APS DPP and to AAPT meetings is
envisioned.


The Technology Infrastructure Fee (TIF) is a consistently-applied direct charge that
is assessed to each and every campus activity unit, regardless of
funding source, including units identified as individual grant and
contract awards.  The TIF pays for campus communication services on
the basis of a monthly accounting of actual usage data.  These costs
are charged as direct costs and are not recovered as indirect costs.
TIF is based on a full time employee (FTE) and is calculated at \$33.28
per FTE per month.  


\subsection*{Indirect Costs}

Facilities and Administration (F\&A) costs are federally negotiated
rate applied to projects as a percentage of the direct costs.  The
UCLA F\&A rate on the Modified Total Direct Cost (MTDC) is 54\%.  MTDC
consists of all salaries and wages, fringe benefits, materials and
supplies, services, travel and the first \$25,000 of each subaward
regardless of the period covered by the sub-grant or subcontract.
Graduate student fee remissions, equipment over \$5,000, and
participant support costs are excluded from MTDC.  On April 27, 2011,
the University of California and the United States Department of
Health and Human Services (the responsible Federal audit agency)
entered into a new facilities and administrative (F\&A) cost rate
agreement for UCLA. This agreement establishes facilities and
administrative cost rates for the period July 1, 2010, through June
30, 2016.  The F\&A rate pertaining to this budget is 54\% of Modified
Total Direct Costs for on-campus research.  A copy of the F\&A rate
agreement can be accessed at: {\ttfamily
  http://www.research.ucla.edu/ocga/Documents/F\_A\_Rate\_Agreement\_4-27-11.pdf}.

%% \subsubsection*{UCLA Contribution}

%% The BaPSF occupies nearly the entire space of the UCLA Science and
%% Technology Research Building

%%  Aside from the usage of
%% nearly an entire building (the Science and Technology Research
%% Building) on Campus the Dean of the College of Letters and Science has
%% promised one quarter of teaching relief each year for the director of
%% the BaPSF.
