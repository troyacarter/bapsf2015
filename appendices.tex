\section{Current  external user groups}

%\subsection{External users}
%Currently, there are thirteen active external user groups of the facility: four independent experimenter user groups, six theory-driven studies and three topical campaigns.  The four experimental groups and six-theory driven studies are listed below as: ?project name?, ?research team? (leader listed first), ?affiliation?.


\subsection{Independent experimenter user groups}

\begin{enumerate}

\item ``Laser Driven shock waves in the LAPD'', C. Niemann,
  C. Constantin (Dept. of Physics and Astronomy,
  UCLA.)\\ High power lasers are used to drive collisionless
  magnetized shocks in LAPD.  A high power ($\sim 100$ J) Nd:YAG laser (repetition rate 10
  minutes) is focused on a target in the LAPD plasma. Measurements and
  simulations corroborate the generation of a collisionless shock
  $(M_{A}\approx 2)$ across the LAPD background field in the presence
  of the dense, LaB$_{6}$ plasma. The interaction is studied with the
  use of multiple magnetic and Mach probes, fast (3 ns) photography, and
  spectroscopy.

\item ``Laboratory Investigation of Auroral Alfv\'{e}n Electron
  Acceleration'', C. Kletzing, F. Skiff, (Dept. of Physics, University
  of Iowa).\\ This is a study of shear Alfv\'{e}n waves with short
  perpendicular wavelengths as well as investigations of field-aligned
  acceleration of electrons due to the electric field of the waves. A
  series of antennas, which are phased arrays, has been developed at
  the University of Iowa and put on the LAPD. The propagation of waves
  launched by these antennas is studied and their dispersion
  mapped. Electron distribution functions perturbed by the Alfv\'{e}n
  waves are measured using a novel whistler wave diagnostic developed
  by the Iowa group. Results are compared with spacecraft
  measurements made in the Earth's auroral region.

%per GM 9/1
%\item ``Development and testing of LaB$_6$ sources for Tri-Alpha
%  Energy,'' D. Bui, A. Song (Tri Alpha)
%
\item ``Tests of Electron Emission and Plasma Production via LaB$_{6}$ Cathodes at High Confining Magnetic Field,"
Y. Song, D. Bui (Tri-Alpha Energy [TAE]), L. Schmidt (UCLA).  The use of high emissivity cathode sources is explored by TAE for use in their fusion device.  This is a synergistic effort, as both TAE and BaPSF are interested in the behavior of LaB$_{6}$ cathodes at magnetic fields approaching one Tesla. TAE provided a high-field magnet, vacuum chamber and power supplies for testing at UCLA.  The UCLA group constructed a cathode (with TAE funds) designed to have minimum stress at high field. Tests at BaPSF have demonstrated the feasibility of the system by documenting the plasma production and source durability during pulsed operation. The system will now be tested at TAE, with BaPSF technical assistance, in the coming year.


\item ``Development of Micro-Electromechanical systems (MEMS) probes for plasma diagnostics",
J. Judy (Department of Electrical Engineering, UCLA)
This project uses the expertise of the MEMS group at UCLA headed by Prof. J. Judy to fabricate a number of microscopic probes for plasma diagnostics.  Prototypes include magnetic pickup coils, energy analyzers and electric field probes.  Some of these could only be seen with a scanning electron microscope.  The Debye length scale ($\sim 20\, \mu$m) electric probe was a crucial tool in the electron hole experiment by Li-Jen Chen (University of New Hampshire).  

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Theory-driven studies}

\begin{enumerate}
\item ``Experimental Study of Magnetospheric Wave Processes",
P. Colestock and M. Light (Los Alamos National Laboratory)\\
This project is driven by a LANL program on radiation belt remediation, which has developed large-scale simulations that model the interaction of electrostatic lower-hybrid (LH) waves with structured plasmas.  Cases of interest are field-aligned density striations (both depletions and enhancements.) To execute the work, a high power, high frequency, slow wave structure was constructed to launch the LH waves. With funds supplied by LANL, the antenna and 16 completely independent RF drivers (1-100 MHz, 300W each) have been installed on the LAPD. Each antenna element is controlled by its own arbitrary waveform generator and used to systematically vary the spatial phasing and amplitude patterns on the array.  The resulting LH waves (incident on striations) are observed to scatter from them; to create standing modes within them; and to mode convert into whistler waves.  The conversion efficiency of LH to whistler waves on a density gradient is measured using high-frequency electric and magnetic probes; this efficiency is found to be many orders of magnitude lower than current theoretical and simulation predictions. 

\item ``Whistler Wave Pitch Angle Scattering of Electrons'', Jacob
  Bortnick (UCLA and NJIT), R.M. Thorne and Xi An (UCLA)\\
  This is a study of
  whistler wave scattering of a beam of energetic electrons. A
  low-density electron beam, with adjustable pitch angle relative to
  the background magnetic field, produces the energetic
  electrons. The velocity distribution function is measured with
  small velocity analyzers. This is done with and without
  background whistler waves. The waves are launched with a small
  loop antenna. Results are compared to theoretical predictions.

\item ``Tearing of a Current Sheet into Magnetic Flux Ropes'',
  W. Daughton, J. Finn (LANL), H. Karimabadi (UCSD)\\ A fully 3D
  kinetic code developed at Los Alamos and using the largest
  multiprocessor computer in the world is used to model the
  tearing of a current sheet into multiple magnetic flux ropes. The
   computations show that the magnetic islands,
  which are the result of the tearing of the current sheet, are helical
  flux ropes which interact with one another. A new high emissivity
  cathode, (installed in the summer of 2013) is masked to
  make a thin (dy/dx=20) current sheet. The full three-dimensional
  evolution of the current is measured in the LAPD, and detailed
  comparisons with theory and the petascale simulations are done.


% per TAC 9/2, \item Kushner?


\item ``Investigation of Sheaths near RF antennas for heating fusion plasmas''\\ D.
  D'Ippolito, J. Myra (Lodestar)\\ This is a study of the RF sheaths on antennas
  immersed in a magnetoplasma. The antennas radiate in the ICRF, Fast
  Wave, regime. Antennas are being constructed at UCLA and waves
  launched at low and high powers into the LAPD edge plasma. A variety
  of probes and optical techniques are used to study the sheath
  plasma waves and their coupling to fast waves, and, under appropriate
  conditions, to shear Alfv\'{e}n waves. The experiments are
  complemented with a modeling effort at Lodestar.\\

\item ``Experimental and Numerical Studies of Whistler Wave Ducting,''
  A. Streltsov (Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University)\\ This study explores
   the propagation of VLF whistler modes in a
  laboratory plasma and compares these results with numerical
  predictions. A key goal is to model the propagation in magnetic
  field-aligned irregularities (also called channels or ducts). High
  frequency $(f \ge f_{ce}/2)$ and low-frequency $(f \le f_{ce}/2)$
  cases are examined.

%% \item "Laboratory Simulation of Magnetic Flux Rope Eruptions in the
%%   Solar Atmosphere", J. Chen, (Naval Research Laboratory.)\\ Solar
%%   flare experiments are conducted in the SMPD, the 4m, low-field
%%   plasma device. The ingredients of the flare experiment geometry are
%%   a current aligned with an arc-shaped magnetic field, together with
%%   fast ions produced by striking, simultaneously, two carbon targets
%%   with laser pulses. This arrangement is embedded in background
%%   magnetic field and plasma. The laser strike represents the eruption
%%   of a magnetic flux loop that is meant to simulate a solar coronal
%%   loop. The laser strike generates plasma flows from the foot-points
%%   of the loop that significantly modify the magnetic field topology
%%   and link the magnetic field lines of the loop with the ambient
%%   plasma. Following this event, the loop erupts by releasing its
%%   plasma into the background. The resulting impulse excites intense
%%   magnetosonic waves, that transfer energy to the ambient plasma and
%%   subsequently decay.



\item ``Search for electron solitary structures,'' L.-J. Chen
  (University of New Hampshire)\\
This project is motivated by the ubiquitous observation made on board
spacecraft of electrostatic solitary structures known as ``electron
holes''. The major outstanding questions are related to the generation,
dynamics and statistics of phase-space structures of spatial dimension
comparable to the Debye length. These features have been investigated
by injecting a small suprathermal electron beam into the LAPD plasma
and measuring the small structures with novel MEMS microscopic probes
that sample the structures at rates much higher than the plasma
frequency. The measured scales and amplitudes of these structures are
comparable to those derived from observation in the
magnetosphere. However, the measured velocities indicate that they are
not generated by an instability driven by the initially injected
beam. Instead, the solitary structures have the same scales and
propagate at the same speed as coherent wave packets and background
fluctuations that are  identified as electrostatic
whistler waves in a strongly Landau damped regime.


\item ``Experimental study of Alfv\'{e}n wave damping processes
  relevant to the solar corona,'' Daniel Wolf Savin, Michael Hahn
  (Columbia University) \\ Shear
  Alfv\'{e}n wave damping and heating are studied in the context
  of explaining heating in solar coronal holes. The waves are
  launched in magnetic field and density gradients, and their
  propagation and  damping are evaluated in a number
  of scenarios. Of special interest is the propagation of waves in
  cross-field density gradients. The gradients are created using
  grids with variable transparency across $B_{0}$ . Another area of
  study is the reflection of shear Alfv\'{e}n waves in large
  magnetic field gradients.

%\item "Conversion of Langmuir Waves to Radio Waves", C. Cattell, P. Kellogg, Dept. of Physics, University of Minnesota.
%% \item "Study of Nonlinear Interaction and Turbulence of Alfv\'{e}n
%%   Waves in LAPD Experiments", S. Boldyrev, J. Perez, University of
%%   Wisconsin, Madison.\\ The project is devoted to analytic and
%%   numerical study of nonlinear interaction and turbulence of Alfv\'{e}n
%%   waves in the LAPD. The research is aimed at extending the results
%%   obtained for incompressible magnetohydrodynamic turbulence to plasma
%%   turbulence, and at providing analytic and numerical support to the
%%   experiments on Alfv\'{e}nic turbulence conducted in LAPD.



\end{enumerate}



\subsection{Campaigns}
The campaigns are listed as: "campaign title", "campaign leader (affiliation)"; external participants:"name (affiliation)" followed by a description. 

\begin{enumerate}

\item "Fast-Ion Campaign"\\ W. Heidbrink (UCI ); participants: M. Van
  Zeeland (General Atomics), B. Breizman (U.Texas, Austin), H. Boehmer
  (UCI), I. Furno (Lausanne), F. Jenko (MPI/UCLA), S. Tripathi,
  S. Vincena, T. Carter (UCLA) \\ An ion beam ( 25 kV , 0.5-3 A) is
   injected at a variety of pitch angles into the LAPD plasma. The
  beam, which spirals along the magnetic field, matches the phase
  velocity of Alfv\'{e}n waves in the background LAPD plasma. The
  waves are expected to be generated by Cherenkov emission from the
  fast ions. The goal is to create an analogue of TAE modes and study
  them in great detail. The project also has related studies such
  as the study of the propagation of shear waves in multiple
  mirrors. Measurement of transport in velocity and configuration
  space caused by harmonic heating with compressional Alfv\'{e}n
  waves, resonances with shear Alfv\'{e}n waves, and drift wave
  turbulence.

  "Study of Ion Transport in Turbulent Plasmas", W. Heidbrink,
  R. McWilliams, H. Boehmer (Dept. of Physics, University of
  California, Irvine.)\\ Continuation of experiments investigating the
  interaction between fast ions and waves and turbulence in LAPD.  A
  moderate energy ($\sim 1$~keV), low current Lithium ion beam is
  mounted in the LAPD. The beam provides a source of test ions, whose
  trajectories spiral around the background
  magnetic field in an argon or helium plasma. The beam profile is
   measured with probes as it moves through localized turbulent
  layers. The layers are generated with antennas. The beam divergence
  and energy spread are also studied.


\item "Auroral Physics Campaign" \\ M. Koepke (West Virginia
  University); participants: C. Chaston (U.C. Berkeley), D. Knudsen
  (U. Calgary), R. Rankin (U. Alberta), S. Vincena, W. Gekelman
  (UCLA) \\ Magnetized plasmas are
  predicted to support electromagnetic perturbations that are static
  in a fixed frame if there is uniform background plasma
  convection. These stationary waves should not be confused with
  standing waves that oscillate in time with a fixed, spatially
  varying envelope. Stationary waves have no time variation in the
  fixed frame. In the drifting frame, there is an apparent time
  dependence as plasma convects past fixed electromagnetic
  structures. In this project, an off-axis, fixed channel of electron
  current (and depleted density) is created in LAPD, using a small, heated, oxide-coated electrode at one
  plasma-column end while the larger plasma column rotates about its
  cylindrical axis from a radial electric field imposed by a special
  termination electrode on the same end. A variety of methods is
  explored to generate $E\times B$ plasma flows in the center of the bulk
  plasma. These include segmented electrodes, spiral electrodes,
  emitting electrodes and a biased center conductor.
 
 
\item "Radiation-Belt Physics Campaign"\\ D. Papadopoulos and
  T. Antonsen (University of Maryland); participants: U. Inan, T. Bell
  (Stanford University), S. Sharma, X. Shao (University of Maryland),
  W. Scales, J. Wang (VA Tech), A. Streltsov (Dartmouth), Y. Wang,
  W. Gekelman (UCLA).\\ The
  campaign is focused on the interaction of energetic electrons with
  launched Alfv\'{e}n and whistler waves. It is motivated by the
  desire to limit damage to satellites by using these waves to scatter
  mirror-trapped energetic electrons into the loss cone. Launching
  shear Alfv\'{e}n waves of arbitrary polarization is accomplished by
  constructing an antenna consisting of two perpendicular coils with
  independent phase-controlled currents. The antenna is found to
  launch highly collimated, relatively large amplitude shear waves
  with wave decay resulting mainly from collisional dissipation. The
  measured radiation patterns of the right-hand mode compare
  favorably to the predictions of an MHD simulation by the Maryland
  group. The second antenna studied is a classic short electric
  dipole. The antenna current and voltage were measured within the
  dipole, avoiding transmission line effects The real and imaginary
  parts of the antenna impedance were measured as a function of
  frequency and time in a decaying, afterglow plasma. A pulsed
  microwave source is used to inject
  waves at 2.45 GHz into a local magnetic mirror.
  The fast electrons vanish when a shear wave, launched by an
  antenna 5 meters away is switched on. When the wave is shut off the
  fast electrons reappear and persist until the microwave source is
  pulsed off.

\section{BaPSF User Group Report}
This section is a reformatted copy of the report generated by the BaPSF external user group following their first formal
meeting, held April 20-21, 2015 at UCLA.

\begin{center}
\subsection{Position Paper and Recommendations of the User Group
at the Basic Plasma Science User Facility at UCLA}
\end{center}

\subsection{I. Introduction}
The Basic Plasma Science Facility at UCLA (BaPSF) is a unique and comprehensive
research facility providing valuable support and frontier-level scientific opportunities for
the plasma sciences. With its suite of plasma devices and extensive particle and wave
generation capabilities, it covers a wide range of plasma conditions with excellent
diagnostic capabilities that are typically not accessible elsewhere.

The purpose of this facility is expressly to explore under controlled and well-diagnosed
conditions the fundamental processes that take place in plasmas ranging from naturally
occurring space and geophysical plasmas to high-temperature fusion plasmas and to
industrial and medical plasma applications. The facility is available to qualified national
and international scientists working in collaboration with an expert BaPSF staff.

The core of the facility is the Large Plasma Device (LAPD). The LAPD is the finest
basic plasma research device in the world. It is the culmination of many years of
research into plasma sources and plasma confinement schemes. The machine produces a
quiescent, highly ionized, 18 meter long plasma in which the ions can be strongly
magnetized; the plasma diameter is fifty centimeters. The plasma source is reliable and
durable; it permits continuous experimentation for several months. Highly reproducible
plasmas are created whose density profiles can be controlled to provide a variety of
conditions encountered in naturally occurring plasmas. An important element of the
LAPD facility is its flexibility of operation. The broad range of operational conditions
permit the investigation of a large class of different phenomena with relative ease.

In addition to the LAPD, the Enormous Toroidal Plasma Device (ETPD), essentially a
large former tokamak. What was once a tokamak has been converted into a 1 Hz pulsed
plasma device employing a high-emission cathode. It has been brought into preliminary
operational status and has the possibility of producing plasmas up to 100 m in length
with the possibility of accessing high beta plasma regimes. While this device has been
little utilized so far, it has the potential of studying a wide range of natural and fusion-related
plasma phenomena.

Finally, several other plasma sources and devices exist within the BaPSF that permit the
study of low temperature plasma phenomena relevant to industrial applications and
diagnostic development. These devices were devised as spin-offs of the technology
developed to support the LAPD functionality, but have provided important scientific
tools on their own account. Because of the great commercial value of such low
temperature plasmas, there is a growing need for such research tools.

The facility has been well-used since its inception and is supported by a User Group and
Scientific Council, who determine the make-up of research projects for the facility. The
User Group met in the spring of this year to discuss research opportunities for the
BaPSF and to formulate a list of potential facility improvements designed to enable
realization of these opportunities. The following is a summary of the consensus of the
BaPSF User Group.

\subsection{II. Recommendations of the BaPSF User Group}

The User Group identified three over-arching areas of study for which the BaPSF can
serve an important role, which cover in large measure the entire field of plasma sciences.
These will be described briefly in the following.

Space Plasma Science

The study of the near-Earth plasmas in the ionosphere and magnetosphere is crucial for
maintaining the integrity of global communication and navigation systems. Moreover,
the longevity of current space assets and the efficacy of space travel itself require a
detailed understanding of the mechanisms that occur within the Earth-plasma system
and its interaction with the solar wind. There are many topics under the general notion
of space weather that require further study, such as the magnetic reconnection problem,
for which the BaPSF has already played an important role. While satellites have
provided a wealth of direct information on space plasmas, BaPSF provides a platform
for the detailed study of these processes that is unique in its scale and diagnostic
capability and serves as an excellent complement to in-situ space data. In addition,
certain solar and interstellar plasmas can be studied with scaled conditions that are
accessible to BaPSF parameters, including shocks, waves, both linear and nonlinear, and
wave-particle interactions.

One area of some practical interest is that of the radiation belts, which present a
potentially life-threatening hazard to our space assets and to space travel itself. While it
is well-known that wave-particle interactions generated by the solar wind tend to
regulate the radiation belt populations, relatively little is known about the details of the
processes involved. The LAPD provides a unique platform for reproducing, and
measuring, the geometry and dynamics of the belt regions.

Fusion Sciences

Another area where BaPSF plays an important support role is in that of fusion science.
For instance, the understanding of edge plasmas and plasma-wall interactions is of
particular importance. The LAPD is large enough to create a plasma with distinct core
and boundary regions with an unequaled diagnostic environment for studying boundary
phenomena. Also, the device is large enough to support many plasma waves of
relevance to fusion devices and is particularly well-suited to the study of important
nonlinear wave processes and wave-particle interactions. In addition, the LAPD is an
excellent device for the study of turbulence and its effect on plasma properties, which
remains a key question in fusion plasmas. Moreover, a particularly beneficial
opportunity arises to be able to verify large-scale plasma simulations in a situation with
relatively simple spatial geometry and comprehensive particle and wave diagnostic
capabilities. Finally, the ETPD can provide a unique high-beta plasma environment for
the study of this regime, which is highly relevant to fusion.

Low-temperature plasma science

The BaPSF can impact the broad area of low temperature plasmas with its diverse range
of plasma sources and comprehensive suite of diagnostics. For instance, it is important
to better understand deposition and etching phenomena in detail, which requires a
comprehensive determination of particle distribution functions along with an
understanding of the associated wave phenomena. The development of micro-probes
and sensor arrays at BaPSF enables the study of such processes in unprecedented detail.
Other possibilities include plasma medical applications such as those where plasmas can
be used to deposit energy within tissue with extreme precision.

As another example of a low temperature plasma suited for study at the BaPSF is that of
lightning, where the ETPD comes into play. This device is unique in the world for
providing a plasma configuration where many mean-free-paths can be contained within
a device that is capable of studying true runaway phenomena, thought to be important in
lightning breakdown.

\subsection{III. Capability Enhancements and Opportunities}

The User Group recommends that certain upgrades to the facility be considered with the
potential scientific benefits as described below.

\begin{enumerate}

\item magnet upgrade - lower collisionality plasma\\
The upgrade of the magnetic field in the LAPD would enhance the overall confinement,
raise the electron temperature and lead to a lower collisionality plasma. This would
enable the study of 3D reconnection and extend the reach of the plasma into the solar
wind regime. This would allow for new studies of particle heating and acceleration in
both magnetospheric and solar coronal plasmas.

\item cathode upgrade to LaB$_{6}$ in LAPD \\
The upgrade of the current BaO cathode to LaB6 will produce a denser and hotter plasma
for access to new plasma regimes (see above) and will facilitate faster turn-around of
machine modifications, leading to a significant increase of machine availability.

\item development of microprobes \\
Prelimininary work at the BaPSF has shown the viability of microprobes in measuring
the particle distribution functions in exquisite detail. The further development of this
technique and deployment in arrays would enable the measurement of wave-particle
interactions and turbulence in space and fusion plasmas and enable the study of a wide
range of phenomena in low temperature plasmas. Diagnostic development remains a
key side benefit of plasma research at the BaPSF.

\item molecular ions/gases \\
The addition of specific new ion and molecular gas species into the BaPSF devices
would enable the study of a broad range of new phenomena relevant to industrial plasma
applications. Bringing the comprehensive diagnostic capability of BaPSF diagnostics
and data acquisition systems to bear on such plasmas would have an immediate and
profound impact on the field of plasma chemistry. This would even extend to many
questions of current interest in the field of astrobiology.

\item relativistic e-beam\\
The addition of a relativistic electron beam would add the important capability to make
precise measurements of the wave-particle interactions associated with the radiation
belts. The current LAPD infrastructure along with the addition of precision beam
diagnostics would enable an unprecedented study of belt dynamics in the truest Earth-based
plasma configuration to date.

\item ETPD\\
Bringing the ETPD into full operation would enable the study of a variety of plasma
phenomena that have never been addressed elsewhere. In particular, the high-beta
plasma regime could be studied regarding wave phenomena and particle transport in an
environment permitting comprehensive diagnostics. The application to fusion plasmas
is evident. In addition, plasma propulsion concepts could be studied, including the
unresolved issue of plasma detachment from magnetized thrusters. As mentioned above,
the study of lightning in this device is a unique opportunity, particularly with regard to
the issue of whether runaway electrons play a key role in determining the threshold for
lightning events. Moreover, the unique energy sources available at the BaPSF and the
diagnostic access of the ETPD provide an excellent opportunity for the study of a wide
range of shock phenomena.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{IV. Summary}
It is clear that the BaPSF fills a special role in the field of plasma physics providing
research opportunities for topics ranging from astrophysics to fusion to industrial
plasmas. The diverse plasma operating regimes combined with excellent diagnostic
capabilities and expert infrastructure support provide a superb environment for studying
various plasma phenomena in unparalleled detail. Not to be underestimated is also the
possibility of training students and enhancing skills of the plasma science workforce,
which is an issue of increasing importance to the national effort.

The BaPSF fills a niche in plasma parameter space that is un-reproduced in most small-scale
plasma laboratories, and underrepresented in large-scale research devices
worldwide. As the dedicated User Group for this facility, we strongly urge the continued
support of the BaPSF, and the enhancement of its research capabilities.
